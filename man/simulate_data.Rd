\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{\itemize{
\item full filepath of the directory where simulated data will be written to
}}

\item{N}{\itemize{
\item number of individuals simulated (must be a whole number)
}}

\item{n_genes}{\itemize{
\item number of genes simulated (must be a whole number)
}}

\item{n_snps_per_gene}{\itemize{
\item number of cis-SNPs per gene (must be a whole number)
}}

\item{n_contexts}{\itemize{
\item number of contexts to simulate (e.g. tissues or cell types) (must be a whole number)
}}

\item{maf}{\itemize{
\item minor allele frequency for genotypes
}}

\item{w_corr}{\itemize{
\item error covariance between contexts
}}

\item{v_e}{\itemize{
\item error variance in each context (maybe take this out and set it to 1)
}}

\item{missing}{\itemize{
\item decimal value signifying percentage of missingness in simulated expression data (e.g. parameter value of 0.3 would indicate 30\% missing values in outputted expression matrix)
}}

\item{hsq}{\itemize{
\item numeric vector with length of the number of contexts representing heritability explained by the eQTL in each context
}}

\item{mus}{\itemize{
\item numberic vector with length of the number of contexts representing average expression in each context.
}}
}
\value{
outputs an expression matrix file, a genotype matrix file, a SNP location file, and a gene location file all in the format needed for FastGxC's decomposition step and then subsequent eQTL mapping step with Matrix eQTL.
